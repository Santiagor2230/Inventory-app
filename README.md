# Inventory-app
## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The overal goal of this app is an application that stores information that a user might want to keep as a reminder in an inventory it could just be items such as groceries, keeping in track the number of places you visit or for anything that a user wants to keep in their own personal database.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The features that allow for user needs and produce a user-center UI is the fact that the desisng allows it to be an application that is personal to the user it does not have a database that is an exterior server but more of the users cellphone, the design is easy to use just to keep in mind the user experience, it has no overwhelming options but generally basic options with titles so the user understands what each page purpose is about and overally it just allows users to have more control of their app.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approach my coding by focusing first on the applications layout before I did the connections between the apps layout and the functionality of each page, after that I took my time to analyze what I was going to start doing first which was the credentials and then what was the next step in the creation of the app. Additionally, the main techniques and strategies is to have steps that I could organized my coding properly and I will applied this to future projects by being organizing through the process of applying my code to other programs.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I test my code through the means of unit testing or simply testing out my code each time I finish a layout that way I did not have to go back and start from 0 to understand what code was implemented incorrectly. The processs is important because it allow me to do things in an organized matter and it made things simple to do, which in theory it reveal in my experience how easier and less stressfull it is to create code without overwhelming errors.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

From the intiial planning I had alot of ideas in mind which most had to be more realistic to create in a short amount of time and understanding this challenge help me to improvised a better plan over time and create an application that was more easier and realistic in the moment to do then something complex that could take more time to develop.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The particularly successfull part in my coding that I demonstrated knowledge of my skills and experience was manly in the SQLite database which was an interesting experience but was satisfying to create since it allow me to be flexible to store anything I wanted so I can later on implemented in other areas in the code as manipulation.
